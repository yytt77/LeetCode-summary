Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Bascially only allows two dupulicates.

var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {

    let res = []
    let j = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== nums[i + 2]) {
        // if there is not 3 dupilication, we increase j
            nums[j]=nums[i];
            j++;
        }
    }
    return j;
};
