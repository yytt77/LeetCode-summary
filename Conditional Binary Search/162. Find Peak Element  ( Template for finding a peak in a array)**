A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

var findPeakElement = function(index) {

    let high = index.length - 1;
    while (low < high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (index[mid] < index[mid + 1]) {
           low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }
    return low
};
